Inflict severe trauma and suffering on others. Along with offering information on the number of people killed and injured, it also makes it easier to analyse bomb explosion suicide attacks by the cities, provinces, and categories that were impacted.


# SOFTWARE USED

# STEPS
STEP 1: open power BI

STEP 2: Get data from excel data (the dataset is a csv file)

STEP3: load data into PowerBI by transforming ( this automatically load data to power query)

STEP4: perform data cleaning ( extraction of date, year and month using text to column, and splitting by left most delimeter, replace empty with zero, replace errors with null or zero,)

STEP 5: Load data into powerBI (by closing and apply) 

STEP6: Add new measures (add min injured and max injured to make total injured, add max killed and min killed to get total killed)

STEP 7: chart visualization

STEP 8: choose chart type and load data into the chart
